    "In this section from the book [Practical Evolutionary Algorithms](https://datacrayon.com/shop/product/practical-evolutionary-algorithms-book/), we're going to take a look at how to use the Platypus framework to apply the non-dominated sorting algorithm to a population of randomly generated solutions. Non-dominated sorting is important during the selection stage of an Evolutionary Algorithm because it allows us to prioritise the selection of solutions based on their dominance relations with respect to the rest of the population. For example, we may wish to only select 25 solutions from a population of 50, with the intention to use these 25 solutions in the variation stage that follows."
